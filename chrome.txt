To install Google Chrome on an Ubuntu system, follow these steps:

### 1. **Download the Chrome .deb package:**
   - Open a terminal (you can use `Ctrl + Alt + T` to launch it).
   - Download the latest Google Chrome `.deb` package using `wget`:
     ```bash
     wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
     ```

### 2. **Install Google Chrome using `dpkg`:**
   - After the download is complete, install the package using the `dpkg` command:
     ```bash
     sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
     ```

### 3. **Fix dependencies (if necessary):**
   - If there are missing dependencies during installation, you can fix them by running:
     ```bash
     sudo apt --fix-broken install
     ```

### 4. **Launch Google Chrome:**
   - Once installed, you can launch Google Chrome from the terminal by typing:
     ```bash
     google-chrome
     ```
   - Alternatively, search for "Google Chrome" in the application menu and open it from there.

### 5. **Set Chrome as the default browser (optional):**
   - If you want to set Google Chrome as your default web browser, you can do so in the system settings under "Default Applications."

With these steps, you should have Google Chrome successfully installed on your Ubuntu system!
